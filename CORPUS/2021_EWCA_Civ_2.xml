            <p>These are appeals against the decision of Lang J dated 17 July 2019, by which she granted (i) a statutory application to quash the grant of planning permission by an Inspector appointed by the Secretary of State, for a change of use of land at 852A-C, Harrow Road, Wembley (“the Appeal Site”), from a mixed use as a builders’ yard and residential to a mixed use as a place of worship and residential; and (ii) a claim for judicial review of the decision by the Inspector to quash an enforcement notice which had been issued by the local planning authority, the London Borough of Brent (“the Council”).</p>

            <p>The Council is the First Interested Party in these proceedings but has played no active part in these appeals. The Secretary of State, who was the Defendant below, is the First Appellant. The Second, Third and Fourth Appellants were interested parties below: they were the beneficiaries of the grant of planning permission by the Inspector. Mr Ikram, who was the Claimant below is the Respondent before this Court.</p>

            <p>The decision by the Inspector to quash the enforcement notice could only be challenged by way of judicial review, whereas his grant of planning permission had to be challenged by way of a statutory application under section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”). That is why there were two sets of proceedings in the High Court but the substantive issues are the same.</p>

            <p>On 19 March 2019, the Council granted retrospective planning permission for Nos 856 and 858, Harrow Road, to be used as a place of worship and community centre. The premises had previously been used for residential purposes and are owned by International Islamic Link (“IIL”). IIL is an unincorporated charity, and the land is registered in the names of four individuals, including the Second Appellant, Mr Hussain, as trustees of the charity. The planning permission was granted subject to conditions to reduce the impact on the surrounding area.</p>

            <p>IIL purchased the Appeal Site in 2012. It undertook construction work and changed the use of the property, in breach of planning controls. The ground floor was established as a Mosque. Planning permission for the construction changes and the material change of use was applied for retrospectively on 24 September 2012. Planning permission was refused by the Council on 9 May 2017.</p>

            <p>On 12 June 2017, an enforcement notice was issued by the Council. It alleged, among other things, a breach of planning controls by a material change of use to a mixed use as residential and a community centre / place of worship.</p>

          <content>
            <p>There was a successful appeal against the enforcement notice by Mr Hussain, acting on behalf of IIL. The Inspector ’s decision was dated 1 November 2018. The main ground of appeal against the enforcement notice was under ground (a) in section 174 of the 1990 Act, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development. Under this ground, IIL submitted that planning permission should be granted to use the Mosque for twice daily prayers with a maximum attendance of 30 people. The Inspector referred to this as “the Limited Use of the Mosque”, at para. 9 of his decision. Planning permission was granted by the Inspector subject to several conditions, to which I will return.</p>

            <p>Mr Ikram applied to the High Court to quash the Inspector ’s decision. Ouseley J granted permission on 31 January 2019 and pointed out what appeared to be a drafting error in condition 1 attached to the planning permission which the Inspector had granted. Condition 1 said: “The Mosque shall only be used as a place of worship.” Ouseley J thought that the condition should have read “only the Mosque shall be used as a place of worship”.</p>

          <num>13</num>
          <content>
            <p>In making his order Ouseley J said: “The claims are plainly arguable. It seems to me that the interpretation of condition 1 is at the core of all the points. If the Claimant is wrong and the use of the whole appeal site is restricted to the use of the mosque for 30 people, then many of the other issues may be resolved. However, I feel bound to say that if the Defendant had to show that his interpretation was arguable, I would refuse permission. The ‘ Appeal Site’ is the whole site, the ‘ mosque’ is a building. The whole site seems to have permission, without restriction, save in the mosque, for the mixed use including as a place of worship. Condition 1 on its natural meaning seems to control the mosque only; there would be, contrary to how the case seems to have been presented, no control on what appears to be the admitted and objectionable use of the rest of the appeal site, where planning permission has on the face of it been granted. Thirty people at any one time in the mosque permits a very large turnover of parking on the site, and overspill facilities. What does the Defendant say is permitted or prohibited there and by what wording?”</p>

            <p>In response to those observations, IIL by its trustees entered into a unilateral undertaking, pursuant to section 106 of the 1990 Act, on 18 April 2019. The undertaking contained planning obligations, including these at clause 3: “3.1.1 not to allow any part of the Land other than the Mosque to be used for the purposes of religious worship pursuant to the Planning Permission; and 3.1.2 not to permit the Mosque to be attended by more than 30 (thirty) people at any one time for the purposes of religious worship in accordance with condition 3 on the Planning Permission”.</p>

            <p>In his decision dated 1 November 2018, he set out the background, at paras. 1-4, and procedural matters, at paras. 5-13. Of particular importance is the way in which he defined the scope of the planning application deemed to be before him under ground (a), at para. 9: “At the Hearing the Appellant [Mr Hussain] confirmed that he was seeking planning permission through the Ground (a) appeal to use the Mosque for twice daily prayers with a maximum attendance of 30 people. I will refer to this as ‘ the Limited Use of the Mosque’.”</p>

          <num>17</num>
          <content>
            <p>The Inspector then set out his reasons for allowing the appeal on ground (a) and for granting the deemed planning application, at paras. 22-57. He referred to relevant planning policies, at paras. 22-24. He then considered the parking and highway safety issues, at paras. 25-26; whether sufficient on-site car parking spaces were available for the Limited Use of the Mosque, at paras. 27-33; whether the Limited Use of the Mosque would result in the interference with the free flow of traffic along Harrow Road or other highway safety issues, at paras. 34-36; whether the Limited Use of the Mosque and the operational development carried out at the appeal site materially harmed the character and appearance of the area, at paras. 37-47; whether the Limited Use of the Mosque would harm the living conditions of nearby residential occupiers, having particular regard to noise, disturbance and lighting, at paras. 48-53; and other matters, for example the fact that the appeal site was next to a public open space, at paras. 54-57.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <num>18</num>
          <content>
            <p>His overall conclusions were set out at paras. 58-60. He concluded that the appeal should succeed on ground (b) to the limited extent that the reference in the enforcement notice to use of the appeal site as a community centre had to be deleted because it was incorrect. More importantly, he concluded that the appeal should succeed on ground (a) and planning permission should be granted. The appeal on ground (g) – that more time should be given to comply with the enforcement notice – therefore did not need to be considered.</p>

            <p>At para. 61 the Inspector set out his formal decision. In particular he granted planning permission on the deemed application under section 177(5) of the 1990 Act for the development already carried out, namely the material change of use of the Appeal Site to a mixed use as residential and a place of worship.</p>

Ground 6, which alleged breach of the Human Rights Act 1998, was not pursued at the substantive hearing. Of the other five grounds, the Judge rejected grounds 2-5 and the first part of ground 1. She accepted the second part of ground 1, which gives rise to the only issue on this appeal.</p>

            <p>At paras. 33 and 34 the Judge said: “33. In R (Lanner Parish Council) v Cornwall Council &amp; Anor [2013] EWCA Civ 1290, the Court of Appeal applied to the planning field some well-established principles restricting the admission of post-decision evidence. Jackson LJ said: ‘ 59. In support of this argument Mr Coppel relies upon the Court of Appeal 's decision in R v Westminster City Council, ex parte Ermakov [1996] 2 All ER 302 … 60. The Court of Appeal held that since the respondent was required to give reasons at the time of its decision and those reasons were deficient, the decision should be quashed. Hutchison LJ gave the leading judgment, with which Nourse and Thorpe LJJ agreed. At 315 h-j Hutchison LJ stated: “The court can and, in appropriate cases, should admit evidence to elucidate or, exceptionally, correct or add to the reasons; but should, consistently with Steyn LJ 's observations in Ex p Graham, be very cautious about doing so. I have in mind cases where, for example, an error has been made in transcription or expression, or a word or words inadvertently omitted, or where the language used may be in some way lacking clarity. These examples are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to reflect my view that the function of such evidence should generally be elucidation not fundamental alteration, confirmation not contradiction. Certainly there seems to me to be no warrant for receiving and relying on as validating the decision evidence – as in this case – which indicates that the real reasons were wholly different from the stated reasons.” 61. In my view that principle is applicable to the present case. The Council was required by article 31of the 2010 Order to give reasons for its decision. The planning permission with the reasons attached is a public document, which anyone is entitled to inspect. The first paragraph of those reasons states that the proposed development accords with policy H20. That paragraph reveals a misunderstanding of policy H20. The Council should not have been permitted to adduce evidence contradicting its own stated reasons. 34. In Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government v Ioannou [2014] EWCA Civ 1432; [2015] 1 P. &amp; C.R. 10, Sullivan LJ said obiter: ‘ I would merely endorse Ouseley J 's observation at [51] of the judgment:" I would strongly discourage the use of witness statements from Inspectors in the way deployed here. The statutory obligation to give a decision with reasons must be fulfilled by the decision letter, which then becomes the basis of challenge. There is no provision for a second letter or for a challenge to it. A witness statement should not be a backdoor second decision letter. It may reveal further errors of law ….".’”</p>

          <content>
            <p>In the present case the Judge then went on to apply those principles to this case. She accepted the submission made on behalf of Mr Ikram that the Inspector ’s evidence should only be admitted in so far as it set out his recollection of what did, or did not, occur at the hearing, in response to the criticisms made against him. She excluded those parts of the witness statement in which he sought to explain or justify his conclusions: namely, the whole of para. 19; the last sentence of para. 20 and the last sentence of para. 21. She considered that those passages were an impermissible attempt to supplement the decision in the light of the challenge in the High Court.</p>

            <p>Turning to the substantive challenge before her, the Judge addressed ground 1 at paras. 47-76 of her judgment. Ground 1 was formulated before the Judge in the alternative. First, it was submitted that the Inspector erred in limiting his consideration to the use of the Mosque, and in failing to consider the use of the other parts of the Appeal Site, even though they were also the subject of the enforcement notice. In the alternative, it was submitted that, even if it was open to the Inspector to limit his consideration to the use of the Mosque, he should have imposed conditions to ensure that the Appeal Site could not be used beyond the Limited Use of the Mosque which he had considered.</p>

            <p>At para. 49, the Judge noted that the ground (a) appeal was an application for planning permission for a material change of use of the entire Appeal Site. However, she went on to note that, following discussion at the hearing, Mr Hussain had reduced the scope of his appeal to the Mosque alone, as recorded by the Inspector at para. 9 of his decision.</p>

            <p>The Mosque had been defined by the Inspector, at para. 1, as the “ground floor of the main building to the rear of No. 852”. The Inspector decided, at para. 12, that his consideration of the appeal would be restricted to the Limited Use of the Mosque. The Council and Mr Hussain agreed to that course. Further, the Inspector accepted the proposal of both parties that he should not consider or decide the planning issues which arose during the “Festival use” of the Appeal Site. This was because that use required a marquee and that would need planning permission, so the planning issues arising from that could be considered at a later date.</p>

            <p>However, at para. 55 of her judgment, the Judge said that the Inspector ’s formal decision at para. 61 “extended far beyond granting planning permission for the Limited Use of the Mosque.” The Inspector granted planning permission for a material change of use to a mixed use as residential and as a place of worship for the entire Appeal Site, not just the Mosque. Thus, the outside space and the outbuildings could all be used as a place of worship. However, the Inspector had not properly considered or determined the highly contentious planning issues which arose in respect of the entire Appeal Site. He had limited his consideration to the use of the Mosque. The Judge concluded on this point: “In my view, this was a fundamental defect in the Decision.”</p>

However, in the light of the observations made by Ouseley J when he granted permission, and the Judge ’s own scepticism, they rightly conceded that the wording of condition 1 did not restrict the use of the remainder of the Appeal Site. In an attempt to rectify the position, on 18 April 2019, the Trustees of IIL had made a unilateral undertaking under section 106 of the 1990 Act.</p>

            <p>The Judge considered that the defects in the Inspector ’s decision-making were particularly significant because of the planning history. She said, at para. 64, that this history implied a lack of respect for the purposes of planning control. She considered, at para. 66, that in the light of that history, the Inspector should have given careful consideration to the need to impose appropriate conditions to control use. The Inspector had recognised the need for such conditions but had “regrettably erred in the manner in which he approached his task. This appeal was an opportunity to establish a workable scheme which would be clear and enforceable, but unfortunately this Decision failed to achieve that objective.”</p>

Regard should be had to the underlying planning purpose for it (Sevenoaks DC v First Secretary of State [2004] EWHC 771 (Admin)). iii) Where a planning permission containing conditions has been granted in a decision by an Inspector allowing an appeal, and a condition is ambiguous, it should be construed in the context of the decision letter as a whole (Hulme v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2011] EWCA Civ 638).</p>

They also provided submissions that the permission as granted could not permit any greater intensity of use than that the subject of the deemed grant of permission. Ms Sheikh reminds this Court that, as a matter of law, intensification of a use of land can amount to a material change of use.

            <p>The issue of the admissibility of post-decision evidence can be addressed briefly. The Judge was prepared to admit the witness statement of the Inspector, Mr Belcher, in large part. She declined to permit certain passages in paras. 19-21 of his witness statement. It seems to me that, apart from one sentence, these passages have no material bearing on the only issue which is now before this Court. The other passages were relevant to grounds of challenge which in fact the Judge rejected. Those grounds are not the subject of any cross-appeal before this Court.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the Judge was well aware of the relevant authorities, in particular the decision of this Court in Ermakov. She expressly referred to the principles established by those authorities, at paras. 33-34 of her judgment, which I have set out above. I do not accept the submission made by Mr Williams on behalf of the Secretary of State (ground 3 of his appeal) that the Judge applied different principles.</p>

            <p>In addressing the main issues, it is important to recall that this case was unusual in that the unilateral undertaking was given not only after the decision by the Inspector but also after the High Court had granted permission to bring these applications: see the Order of Ouseley J dated 31 January 2019. Furthermore, Ouseley J set out in some detail what his reasons were for granting that permission.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as appears to have been conceded at first instance, at least on the part of the Secretary of State, there was an error of law in the Inspector ’s decision which required to be corrected by way of the unilateral undertaking: see the Secretary of State ’s Detailed Grounds of Defence, at paras. 11(ii) and 15(ii). In that document the Secretary of State said that he “will accept that Ground 1 – and specifically Ground 1(b) – is made out” (para. 11(ii)); but that, if a unilateral undertaking were forthcoming, he would “contend that this error is rendered academic” (para. 15(ii)).</p>

          <content>
            <p>It follows therefore that the terms of the undertaking were never considered by the Inspector for the obvious reason that he did not have that undertaking before him at the time. It seems to me that many of the submissions which have been made on behalf of the Secretary of State and the other Appellants, which have focussed upon the need to respect the planning judgement of the Inspector unless that judgment is Wednesbury unreasonable, are therefore not to the point. There was no planning judgement formed by the Inspector on the relevant issue.</p>

            <p>It seems to me to be clear that, if the undertaking had not been volunteered, the High Court would have been entitled, and probably bound, to quash the Inspector ’s decision because there was an obvious error of law which remained uncorrected.</p>

            <p>The question then becomes whether the Judge was required to accept that the undertaking did indeed correct the error in the decision. It seems to me that she was not.</p>

            <p>First, it is common ground (inevitably) that the interpretation of the undertaking is a question of law and is therefore a question for the court.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it must be common ground that the interpretation of a planning permission is also a question of law. This is important not least because the rights of third parties may be affected, and not only the rights of the persons directly concerned. For example, neighbours need to know with reasonable certainty what is or is not permitted on adjoining land. Furthermore, potential purchasers of land need to know what they will be permitted to do if they invest in the purchase of property. It is important to recall that a planning permission creates proprietary rights and is not personal to a particular occupier or developer. It runs with the land.</p>

          <content>
            <p>It is important in this context to bear in mind the following passage in the judgment of Sullivan LJ in R (Thomas Brown) v Carlisle City Council [2010] EWCA Civ 523; [2010] JPL 1571: “42. [Counsel] told us that if we concluded, contrary to his submissions, that the grant of permission was unlawful, the Interested Party was prepared to give an undertaking to the Court, to be incorporated into a section 106 planning obligation so as to bind the land, that it would not commence development of the Freight Distribution Centre until screening of both it and the airport works had been undertaken by the Defendant under the EIA Regulations. It is difficult to see what purpose would be served by the court ’s acceptance of such an undertaking that would not equally well be served by the quashing of the permission. A planning permission is a public document. Third party rights, e.g. the rights of agricultural tenants on the land, may be affected by the existence, or otherwise of a planning permission. There would have to be some very good reason to persuade the court that acceptance of an undertaking that an unlawful permission would not be implemented, or would be implemented only on certain terms, would be a more appropriate course than a decision to quash an unlawful permission. No such reason has been identified in this case. It follows that the EIA challenge to the permission succeeds and the permission must be quashed.”</p>

            <p>Both Mr Williams and Ms Sheikh relied on what was said by Lindblom J in the case of R (TWS) v Manchester City Council and FC United Limited [2013] EWHC 55 (Admin); [2013] JPL 972, at para. 86, and in particular on the passage which I have emphasised below: “I come finally on this issue to the relevant provisions in the s.106 obligations. If I were wrong to hold, as I have, that there was no legal onus on the City Council to limit by condition the annual number and daily duration of events in the stadium, I would nevertheless regard the commitments made by FC United in the agreement of October 19, 2012 and the deed of variation of December 19, 2012 as conclusive. A similar view was reached in Midcounties Co-Operative Ltd [2010] EWCA Civ 841. It is not – and can not be – in dispute that a planning obligation in suitable terms is capable of putting right a defect in the conditions originally imposed on a grant of planning permission. Here the agreement of October 19, 2012 provides enforceable limitation on the hours of use of the stadium pitch and the other public pitches and facilities in the development. …” (Emphasis added)</p>

            <p>As is apparent from that passage, it was obiter. The principal basis on which Lindblom J reached his decision was that there was no legal onus on the planning authority in that case to limit by condition the annual number and daily duration of events at the football stadium concerned.</p>

            <p>Secondly, I would observe that the principle as stated by Lindblom J, that a planning obligation “in suitable terms” is capable of putting right a defect in the conditions originally imposed on the grant of planning permission, is not in dispute in the present case either. The crucial questions, it seems to me, are (i) whether the planning obligation is indeed “in suitable terms”; and (ii) whether an undertaking in a given case does indeed put right a defect in the conditions originally imposed.</p>

          <content>
            <p>Thirdly, as I read that passage, Lindblom J was not suggesting that the test to be applied by the reviewing court is simply one of irrationality. To the contrary, he considered for himself whether the section 106 obligation was sufficient to overcome what would otherwise have been a legal error.</p>

          <content>
            <p>Furthermore, it is important to note that, at para. 85, Lindblom J said, by reference to authority, that it was as a matter of law elementary that a local planning authority has no power on a planning application to grant permission for more than has been applied for. By way of example, he mentioned an application for a supermarket, where the area to be the subject of a planning permission (measured in square metres) is set out in the application. That area then sets the maximum for which planning permission can be granted.</p>

            <p>The difficulty in the present context may flow from the fact that there was no actual application for planning permission. There was only a deemed application. Since this case arose from enforcement action, the scope of any deemed application for planning permission, under section 177(5) of the 1990 Act, is “the matters stated in the enforcement notice as constituting a breach of planning control.”</p>

            <p>However, as Mr Streeten submitted before us and does not appear to be disputed as a matter of principle, it is open to the parties to agree before the Inspector that the terms of the deemed application for planning permission are to be narrower than the description of the breach of planning control set out in the enforcement notice. On the facts of the present case, that is exactly what happened at the hearing before the Inspector, as noted by him at para. 9 of his decision. It followed that the only matter for which permission was sought on the deemed application before the Inspector was in respect of what he called “the Limited Use of the Mosque”. That phrase had a specific meaning which the Inspector himself gave it, which included prayers at the mosque which would take place only twice a day.</p>

            <p>The consequence was that the undertaking did not and could not overcome that difficulty. At most what the undertaking could do was to correct what the Secretary of State and the other Appellants submit was merely a drafting error in the drafting of condition 1.</p>

          <content>
            <p>In my view, the error into which the Inspector fell went well beyond that drafting error. In my view, in agreement with Lang J, the Inspector fell into a fundamental error of approach because, having considered the planning impacts which flowed from the Limited Use of the Mosque only, he went on to grant planning permission for something which was much broader.</p>

            <p>This is reinforced by the consideration that a planning permission is not personal to this particular occupier. Even if it may be difficult to envisage in practice at the moment, as a matter of law the land could be sold to others. The permission is not limited to any particular denomination. The Judge was therefore entitled to test what could occur compatibly with the planning permission granted on hypothetical facts. She was not bound to consider only what had occurred or would occur on the evidence relating to this particular occupier.</p>

          <content>
            <p>By way of example, the planning permission granted by the Inspector, even with the conditions attached to it and read with the unilateral undertaking, would, on its true construction, permit not only prayers but other services, such as weddings and funerals. These could in principle take place “back to back”, so that no more than 30 people would be in the Mosque at any one time but there could be other people congregating at the Appeal Site but outside the Mosque, waiting for their event to take place inside it. The fundamental problem is that the planning merits of permitting development which may have such consequences were not assessed by the Inspector. The Inspector erred in his approach as a matter of law. The High Court did not impermissibly intrude into the sphere of the planning merits or expert judgement. It did what it is there to do: correct errors of law.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, I accept the submission by Mr Streeten on behalf of the Respondent that the judgement about whether the undertaking was sufficient to cure the problems which had led to the grant of permission to bring these proceedings in the High Court was essentially one for the Judge at first instance. This Court does not sit to re-hear the case. Rather its function is to conduct an appeal by way of review pursuant to CPR 52.11(1). The question for this Court is whether the Judge was “wrong”, by asking whether the Judge had legitimate and proper grounds for reaching the decision she did: see Smech Properties Limited v Crest Nicholson Operations Limited and Others [2016] EWCA Civ 42, at para. 27 (Sales LJ). Furthermore, as Sales LJ went on to state at para. 28, an appellate court will only find a decision to be “wrong” if the judge at first instance has misdirected herself or has reached a conclusion which is manifestly incorrect or unjust. Furthermore, as he said at paras. 29-30, the weight to be accorded to the view of the first instance judge may also be affected by their expertise (Lang J is an experienced judge of the Planning Court); and the fact that the first instance judge had the opportunity to consider the facts in the round, whereas this Court only has a limited opportunity to see part of the whole picture.</p>
